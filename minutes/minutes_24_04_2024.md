- Some kind of GUI or game shown on the screen 
- Will can make a joy-stick
    - ticks the actuator box 

#### Pictionary Idea: 
- Use joy stick to draw an image
- Could use a 3D printer setup to physically draw it
- Or a display on the computer 

#### Maze Idea
- Approved by tutor
- Use a joystick (that operates using potentiometers) to tilt a maze that contains a marble. 
- Maze platform is tilted using servos 
    - use this system with servos: https://youtu.be/JkJ851Pya0I?si=VTKCS693HPFE_Ybs&t=647 
- Marble has to hit a certain number of checkpoints to win the game 
    - checkpoints are LDRs
- Score/progress and count down is displayed on the computer 
- Can make the checkpoints moveable
